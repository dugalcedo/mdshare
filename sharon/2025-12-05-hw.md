## 👩‍💻 Absolute Beginner Web Dev Challenge: The HTML Shortcut Builder

This assignment is designed to help you get **comfortable and fast** with your main tool, **VS Code**, and build a solid foundation in **HTML**.

**It is a NO-CSS Challenge.** Your finished page will look plain, but that is 100% expected! The focus is on structure and efficiency.

### 🎯 Goal

Create a simple HTML document (`index.html`) that acts as a basic "Profile Builder" form, using only the HTML elements and VS Code shortcuts listed below.

### 🛠️ Part 1: VS Code Shortcut Training

Before you start writing code, you need to learn these essential shortcuts. They will make you write code much faster!

* **⚠️ Note on Keyboard Shortcuts:** The shortcuts below are for Windows/Linux. If you are on a **Mac**, use the **Command (Cmd)** key where you see **Control (Ctrl)**, and the **Option (Opt)** key where you see **Alt**.

| Action | Windows/Linux Shortcut | Mac Shortcut | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Select Next Match** | Ctrl + D | Cmd + D | Selects the current word and the *next* time it appears. Keep pressing to select many! Great for renaming variables quickly. |
| **Multiple Cursors** | Alt + Click | Opt + Click | Hold Alt/Opt and click anywhere in your code to place multiple typing cursors. |
| **Insert Line Below** | Ctrl + Enter | Cmd + Enter | Adds a new, blank line **below** your current line, no matter where your cursor is on the line. |
| **Toggle Comment** | Ctrl + / | Cmd + / | Quickly turns the selected lines into an HTML comment (``) or removes the comment. |
| **Copy/Cut/Paste** | Ctrl + C / X / V | Cmd + C / X / V | The universal copy, cut, and paste shortcuts. |
| **Undo/Redo** | Ctrl + Z / Y | Cmd + Z / Cmd + Shift + Z | Undoes (Z) or Redoes (Y/Shift+Z) your last action. |

> **❓ How to Check Your Shortcut:** If Ctrl + / doesn't work for commenting, you can check what the shortcut is! Go to the menu: **Code → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts** (on Mac) or **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts** (on Windows). Search for "Toggle Line Comment."

### 🚀 Part 2: HTML Abbreviation Power-Up

VS Code has a feature that lets you type short codes that expand into full HTML elements. This is your first taste of automation!

| Abbreviation | Type this... | Then press **Tab** | ...to get this |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Structure** | `!` | Tab | Full basic HTML boilerplate |
| **List Items** | `ul>li*3` | Tab | `<ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul>` |
| **Label + Input** | `label+input` | Tab | `<label for=""></label><input type="text" id="">` |

### 📝 Part 3: The Profile Builder Task

Use an empty `index.html` file and your new shortcuts to create the following structure.

#### **Step 1: Boilerplate and Title**

1.  Open VS Code and create a new file named `index.html`.
2.  Type `!` and press Tab to generate the basic HTML boilerplate.
3.  Change the `<title>` to "**My Shortcut-Built Profile**".

#### **Step 2: Main Heading & Description**

1.  Create a main heading: "**My Profile Builder**" using an `<h1>` tag.
2.  Create a paragraph below it explaining the page: "**This page uses only basic HTML elements and was built with VS Code shortcuts.**"

#### **Step 3: The User Input Section**

Create the following fields using the **VS Code Abbreviation** (`label+input`) and then your shortcuts:

1.  **Full Name:** A `<label>` and an `<input type="text">`.
2.  **Email Address:** A `<label>` and an `<input type="email">`.
3.  **Profile Image URL:** A `<label>` and an `<input type="url">`.
4.  **A Short Bio:** A `<label>` and an `<input type="text">` (you may use a `<textarea>` if you remember it!).

> **Shortcut Practice:** Use **Ctrl + D** (or **Cmd + D**) to quickly select and change both the `for` attribute on the labels and the `id` on the inputs to make them match (e.g., `id="name"` and `for="name"`).

#### **Step 4: The Profile Summary**

Below the input section, use the following elements:

1.  **Image:** Use the `<img>` tag. Set the `alt` attribute to something descriptive like "User Profile Picture" and the `src` to any image URL you find on the internet (e.g., a picture of a cat, a logo, etc.).
2.  **Unordered List:** Use the `<ul>` tag. Give it at least 3 list items (`<li>`) describing your profile. (Use the **VS Code Abbreviation** `ul>li*3`!)
    * *Example:* `<li>Hobby: Hiking</li>`
    * *Example:* `<li>Favorite Food: Tacos</li>`
3.  **Anchor/Link:** Create an anchor tag (`<a>`) that links to a helpful website (e.g., `href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"`). The text of the link should be "**Learn More HTML**".

#### **Step 5: The Shortcut Reference (Self-Commentary)**

Use your **Toggle Comment** shortcut (**Ctrl + /** or **Cmd + /**) to add a block of comments *at the bottom of your file* that explains which shortcuts you used the most and why.

### ✅ Submission Checklist

* The file is named `index.html`.
* The page includes an `<h1>`, a `<p>`, and a link (`<a>`).
* The form section includes at least 4 pairs of `<label>` and `<input>` tags.
* An `<img>` tag is present with `src` and `alt` attributes.
* An `<ul>` list with at least 3 `<li>` items is present.
* You used **VS Code Abbreviation** to create at least one set of elements (`!`, `ul>li*3`, or `label+input`).
* You successfully used **Ctrl + D** (or **Cmd + D**) to edit multiple items at once.
* You used **Ctrl + /** (or **Cmd + /**) to add your final block of comments.

Good luck! You've got this!
